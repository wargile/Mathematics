Solve for x:
------------
x = (x / 4) + ((24 - x) / 2)

--> Find common denominator for the fractions and add them together:
x = (x / 4) + ((48 - 2x) / 4)
--> x - 2x = -x, so we get:
x = ((48 - x) / 4)
--> Multiply with 4 on each side to get rid of the fraction:
4x = (48 - x)
--> Add x on each side to get rid of the -x on the right:
4x + x = 48
5x = 48
--> Divide by 5 on each side:

--> Answer: x = 48/5
